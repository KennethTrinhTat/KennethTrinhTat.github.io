I am a computer engineering major at CSUF and I expect to graduate in 2028-29.

## Favorite CPSC 120L labs

Lab 3 part 1

This part of the lab interested me because I am a person who’s trying to lose weight and it’s cool to be writing code in order to calculate BMI through a person’s data. This lab gave me a chance to experiment with real data. Debugging and writing small, incremental changes to code satisfying as I get to see my program come together and work properly.

Lab 7 part 1

I really enjoyed this lab because coding the parking rules for each street was fun as I was figuring out how to plug in the different restrictions for Ash, Beech, and the others. I liked making sure the program checked the right times and days and properly flagged when parking wasn’t allowed. Testing everything felt like solving a puzzle, and it was satisfying to see the program work perfectly at the end. 

Lab 11 part 1
This lab was enjoyable for me since it allowed me to deal with actual data and come up with many different solutions by determining population density. It was also cool to see which states had the highest and lowest densities. I liked watching the code come along and function properly and see the code work and come up with actual real world answers was great. I was kept interested by the task of arranging things in an object-oriented manner, and it was amazing to watch the software execute everything without any issues because it gave me a sense of accomplishment.
